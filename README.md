## Overview
This page is used for querying github users. It uses the Githubg User API in order to fetch user data. 
This is just a project to build my portfolio and experiment with REST APIs. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### Built with

- TAILWIND CSS
- JQUERY
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Anime js 
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG Injector 


### What I learned
- In this section i learned that SVG's imported in an img tag cannot be styled with CSS (In order to make it work you have to use a so called SVGInjector)
- Experimented with Tailwind responsive querries 
- SVG Morphing Animation 
- DARK/LIGHT mode animation 

### Continued development

In the future i would like to authenticate the API calls so its not just 60 fetches/ hour. And also add some cool animations to the page.
